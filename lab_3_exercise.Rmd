## Data

## Single trait distribution
```{r}
View(penguins)
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = species))

```
A gentoo penguin weighing approximately 6300 g has the highest body mass of the data set, and a chinstrap penguin weighing approximately 2700 g has the lowest body mass.

## Relationship between multiple traits
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species))
```
Bill length in mm and body mass in g are proportionally related.

##Sexual Dimorphism
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
In all three species, females tend to have lower bill lengths and body masses than males.
